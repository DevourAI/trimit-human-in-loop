You will be provided with a version of a transcript of a video interview that has been cut down to follow along with a narrative story provided below,
along with
  - the original user prompt that guided the creation of the story and video
  - feedback from the human editor after seeing this cut transcript
The video is supposed to be a customer testimonial.

Unfortunately, the AI agent that generated this transcript did not cut it down short enough.
Our goal is to cut down the video to {{ length_seconds }} seconds. At 130 words per minute, this is approximately {{ total_words }} words.
The current transcript is {{ transcript_nwords }} words long, which is {{ transcript_nwords - total_words }} words over the target length.
IF IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT.
{% if round_num > 0 %}
You already attempted to cut down the transcript {{ round_num }} times, but it is still too long by {{ transcript_nwords - total_words }} words.
Try again, making MANY MORE ADDITIONAL CUTS TO SHORTEN THE LENGTH.
{% endif %}

<narrative_story>
{{ narrative_story }}.
</narrative_story>

<user_prompt>
{{ user_prompt }}
</user_prompt>

{% if user_feedback %}
The human editor provided the following feedback on the previous cut transcript that you should take into account:

<critiques_from_human_editor>
{{ user_feedback }}
</critiques_from_human_editor>

{% endif %}

Your job is to first critique the output, write out your thought process, and then suggest enough additional cuts or modifications that will shorten the overall wordcount to {{ total_words }},
while keeping the output clear, concise, close to the narrative story, and taking into account the human editor's feedback.
You MUST surround your final output in <transcript></transcript> tags.
ONLY INCLUDE WORDS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THE STORY, BUT MAKE SURE THESE WORDS ARE FOUND IN THE CORRECT LINEAR ORDER IN THE ORIGINAL TRANSCRIPT.
All other segments, if included, will be removed from the transcript and final video.
Remember, the video already exists, so the words you provide must have already been spoken in the video, and thus exist in the provided transcript.
YOU MUST REMOVE SOME OF THE WORDS IN THE TRANSCRIPT TO SHORTEN IT TO THE REQUIRED LENGTH.
In order to do this:
Add <remove></remove> tags around segments you want to remove.
Add <keep></keep> tags around segments to you want to keep.
All other words, not surrounded by <keep> tags will be removed.

EXAMPLE
If the input was "My name is Ben. At Washington Post we use Liveramp for many of our data processing needs."
the final output could be "<transcript><keep>we use Liveramp for </keep> many of <keep>our data processing needs.</keep></transcript>".
