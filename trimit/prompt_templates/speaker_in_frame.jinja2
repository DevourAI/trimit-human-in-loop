Based on mouth movement in the provided set of frames from a single video, is the person who is on camera most likely the one currently talking?
If the person on camera's mouth is moving in a portion of the frames, they are the one talking.
If there is no person viewable in the frames, or you cannot see the person's mouth, they are not talking.
Respond with a JSON-parseable `{"speaking": true}` or `{"speaking": false}`
