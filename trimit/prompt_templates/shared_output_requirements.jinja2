<output_requirements>
The beginning and end of your transcription output should be marked with <transcript> and </transcript>, respectively.
The content inside of this output will be automatically parsed by our video generation system.

Do not modify any individual words or phrases of the transcript, since we will just be cutting the existing footage.
Instead, provide <keep></keep> tags around the segments you want to keep, and <remove></remove> tags around the segments you want to remove,
such that the entire input partial transcript is included in your output with only <keep></keep> and <remove></remove> tags added.
Every segment of transcript you want to keep should have a <keep> tag before it and a </keep> tag after it.
Every segment of transcript you want to remove should have a <remove> tag before it and a </remove> tag after it.
Each segment in <keep> or <remove> tags in your output should exactly match a contiguous block of text from the transcript.
You must make sure that there are no stray <keep>, </keep>, <remove>, or </remove> tags that don't have a corresponding pair.

Don't be afraid to cut across sentence boundaries if it makes sense, and don't be afraid to be ruthless in what you remove.
Filler words ("Okay", "And", "Um", "So", etc), repetitions, short answers to questions ("Yes", "Yep", "No") and other non-essential content should be removed.
We need to keep the narrative concise and engaging.
Generally, you should not include sentences phrased in the second-person (you, your, etc.), since these are likely coming from the interviewer.
